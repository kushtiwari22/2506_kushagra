In this project, I start by loading the train and test datasets and concate both of them.  Then I normalize the features using StandardScaler to standardize the data. 
Subsequently, I apply various machine learning models to the datasets, performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model's performance. 
Finally, I explore combining predictions from multiple models to improve the overall prediction accuracy.
